# Project

Use this directory for your projects.  It's recommended that each of the sub-directories here is a separate git repository clone.

```
git clone git@github.com:ExeterBScDTS/msa-recap-react-ui.git
git clone git@github.com:ExeterBScDTS/msa-recap-ffmpeg-container.git
```

Note, to find the upstream URL use ```git remote show origin```
